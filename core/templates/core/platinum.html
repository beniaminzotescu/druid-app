                <p>Platinum is a chemical element with the symbol Pt and atomic number 77. It is a dense, malleable,
                    ductile, highly unreactive, precious, silverish-white transition metal. Its name originates from
                    Spanish platina, a diminutive of plata "silver".</p>
                <p>Pure platinum is a lustrous, ductile, and malleable, silver-white metal. Platinum is more ductile
                    than gold, silver or copper, thus being the most ductile of pure metals, but it is less malleable
                    than gold.</p>
                <p>Its physical characteristics and chemical stability make it useful for industrial applications. Its
                    resistance to wear and tarnish is well suited to use in fine jewelry.</p>
