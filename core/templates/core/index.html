                <p>Welcome to Testin Inc, here we thrive on bug hunting all (work)day for our awesome companies thus
                    helping
                    them continuously offer quantity products to their customers.</p>
                <p>We were founded in 20020 by someone who was laid off due to the pandemic ... while mindlessly
                    spending hours
                    on end scrolling through social media, they discovered lots of insects on a very well known S&M
                    platform,
                    they reported their findings and ta-da! They got their first client! That is when they realized that
                    testin is their true purpose in life so they founded Testing Inc., a company that's on fast track to
                    being
                    the best testing company in the world!</p>
